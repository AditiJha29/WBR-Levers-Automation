# WBR-Levers-Automation
This project focuses on automating the directional and vibration levers in walk-behind rollers (WBR), commonly used in construction for soil and asphalt compaction. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency and precision by replacing manual lever control with a motorized system.

I have developed three potential ideas for the design and implementation of an automated control system for the Walk-Behind Roller (WBR).

1.YokeDrive: Stepper-Based Automation 2.Actuators: Relay-Driven Automation 3.ScotchDrive: Servo-Enhanced Motion
